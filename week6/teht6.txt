Task 6

a) 
I think the hardest topics was multi-threading and concurrency, but this might be because it was introduced pretty late on the course and personally I didn't have much experience in C programming before the course.
First few week dwelled too long on pipes and somewhat on fifos.

b)
During the course there where several mentions that a specific way of handling errors or signals isn't production quality but they were little to none examples that could be good enough "for production". 
Their could be few examples on how to handle things in a way that is comprehensive enough for a production setting.
Also they're could be more exercises on multi-threading as it's an important topic for concurrent servers an it could become right after the students are familiar with fork.
The first we weeks could talks less about pipes and go faster to sockets. Yes, using pipes gives you a nice basic understanding of how sockets work, but when you have written few applications using them their usage has become pretty clear.

c)
Lecture notes could include less code examples and more summaries. The course book included nice written out explanations for many functions and how use them correctly. 
These could be used more in the lecture notes and maybe link the code examples to material and only include the relevant parts on the notes.

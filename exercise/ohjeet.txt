# 101 Hello Halonen Joona S at melkinpaasi.cs.helsinki.fi. Wait a moment.

# 205 Make your own concurrent server (no hello greetings). You have 5 seconds time to create your service at port 22074
# 106 Don't call us - we'll call you!
# 310 Problems with the first connection to your server!
# 209 Goodbye, UNIX_TL server closing connection.






# This is a comment, ignore it.
# Implement these commands:
# first char  meaning...
#  #  comment - ignore this line
#  E  echo - send this line back in uppercase, including starting letter E
#  C  code - send the pathname (filename) of your server program source code
#            It should be a relative pathname to your home directory  /home/fs/joonahal/
#  F  <file> <port>
#     F command requests you to create a file transfer connection to the
#     port <port> and to send the file named <file> over this connection.
#     <file> is the absolute pathname of the file to be sent.
#     Before creating the file transfer connection you should send the
#     size of the requested file (in bytes) as a reply to the F command.
#     Example:
#     F /home/fs/kojo/.profile 12553
#     Steps to be taken:
#     1) Reply with the size of the file /home/fs/kojo/.profile: 1238
#     2) Connect to the port 12553 and send the file via this new connection
#     3) Close the file transfer connection
#
#
#  A   accept - be happy don't worry
#  Q   quit - this connection
# I will send you command A when your program seems to work!

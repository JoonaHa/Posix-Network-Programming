How does TCP layer react at a server host when a TCP SYN segment arrives at the server but the backlog queue of the listen socket is
full. How is this visible in the client application that is trying to connect the server?


If the servers backlog queue of the LISTEN socket is full the server fill simply ignore the
SYN package and does not send a RST segment.
This has the effect that the client fill simply try to send it the SYN-segment
again and only causes some delay while connecting.

If the RST-segment was sent the client application needs to handle
the RST-segment.
Ignoring the SYN lets the TCP's retransmission protocol take over.
